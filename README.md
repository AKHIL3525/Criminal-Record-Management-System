# Criminal-Record-Management-System
The **Criminal Record Management System (CRMS)** is a web-based application that enables **admins** to add, view, and delete criminal records while allowing **users** to search for criminal details. The system requires **user authentication**, redirecting admins to a dashboard with all functionalities and users to a search-only interface. Criminal records should be stored in **local storage** to ensure data persistence across sessions. The **view criminal page** should function like Google Search, initially displaying only a search bar and revealing details upon entering a valid name. The **add criminal page** must store new records in local storage, making them retrievable in the **view criminal page**, while the **delete function** should permanently remove records. The current issues include the **background image not displaying correctly**, **added criminals not appearing in search results**, and **UI misalignment**. Enhancements are needed to ensure **proper data storage, seamless retrieval, improved styling, and a more user-friendly experience**. The goal is to create a **fully functional, visually appealing, and efficient CRMS** that meets these requirements. ðŸš€
